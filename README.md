# Relational-Database-and-Application
CMPE 138
The project consists of a non-trivial relational database to support a particular activity, event, or organization,
and a database application as front-end to access the database. 
- The initial project phases will concentrate on the design and construction of the relational database;
- The final phases will add an application with sufficient power to update, retrieve, and display information from the database, and to allow new data to be added to the database.
